# what is it?!
eaglerforge is a continuation of eaglerreborn's PluginAPI with more features and a fork of [eaglercraft](https://eaglercraft.com/). eaglerforge has a custom javascript api that allows modders to modify eaglercraft without [java](https://java.com) knowledge

# NOTE:
eaglerforge DOES NOT support minecraft forge jar files.
